# 🔧 Phone Authentication Error - Fixed!

## ❌ Error: `auth/billing-not-enabled`

This error occurs because **Phone Authentication** requires Firebase's **Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan**.

---

## ✅ Solution: Use Admin Email/Password Login

I've configured the app to use **Admin Login by default** instead of Phone OTP.

### What I Changed:

1. ✅ **Default login mode** changed to "Admin Login"
2. ✅ **Added warning message** on Phone Login tab
3. ✅ **Better error handling** for billing errors
4. ✅ **Admin login works on FREE plan** (no billing required!)

## 🚀 How to Login Now:

### **Option 1: Admin Login (Recommended - FREE)**

1. Open: http://localhost:5173
2. You'll see **"Admin Login"** tab selected by default
3. Click **"Show Default Admin Credentials"**
4. Use any admin account:
   - Email: `admin1@cms.local`
   - Password: `Admin@123`
5. Click **"Login as Admin"**

✅ **This works on Firebase FREE plan!**
